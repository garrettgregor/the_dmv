# Notes to Self

## Iteration 1

- Wtf is `require 'date'` in line 1 of the vehicle class? Is date a standard gem file that's being accessed in `Date.antique?`
- Utilizing the `attr_accessor` instead of `attr_reader` in vehicle class for the registration date since, presumably, it will need to be accessed/edited later on when that car is registered
